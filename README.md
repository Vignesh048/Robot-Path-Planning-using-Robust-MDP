# Robot-Path-Planning-using-Robust-MDP

# Introduction
  -->Optimal solutions of MDP are sensitive to the state transition probabilities. 
  
  -->Estimation of the state transition probabilities are far from accurate in real life situations.
  
  -->Which limits the usage of MDP in real life problems

# Motivation
  -->The aim is to build the robust control strategy for finite state and finite action MDP’s when transition probabilities are uncertain.
  
  -->The solution could be obtained using variant of the classical dynamic programming algorithm, the “robust dynamic programming” algorithm.
